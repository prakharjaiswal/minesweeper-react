## To setup
- **npm install** to install dependencies
- **npm start** to start the server
- **Goto browser** after the server is ready and load the game http://localhost:3000/

## Todo
- better UI (looks yuck currently)
- better state management
- Grid cell dimension logic is ugly and hard coupled, fix it
